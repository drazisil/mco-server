# Configuring the client to connect to the server

This currently has only been tested with the debug version of the client. If you don't have those files and instructions the server _might_ work, but is not currently supported.

## Registry

* copy `sample.reg` in the project root to a new file with the same extension
* Modify all instances of `dev.mco` in the new file to be your server's DNS or IP
* Double-click the registry file to import and overwrite the default registry settings for the client

### Client/Server Encryption Setup

* Copy the pub.key file from `https://<server>/key` to the client game directory. Overwrite when prompted.

* Download the SSL cert from `https://<server>/cert` and add it to the Trusted Root Store.
